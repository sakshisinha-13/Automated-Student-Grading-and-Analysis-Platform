Customizable Grading System: Supports scaling of grades based on predefined criteria, ensuring flexibility and adaptability to diverse evaluation standards.
Interactive Visualizations: Provides a user-friendly interface to visualize student data, grading details, and analytics.
Sorting and Filtering: Enables sorting by roll number or grade and facilitates data exploration for better performance insights.

Prerequisites:
Python 3.8 or above
Required Python libraries:
streamlit
pandas

Output
The application will generate a table with:
Total Marks: Calculated based on given weightage.
Grades: Assigned dynamically based on thresholds.
Scaled Grades: Adjusted to ensure fair distribution.
