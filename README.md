The app is designed to compute total marks, assign grades, and scale them based on customizable grading criteria, offering an intuitive interface for educators to analyze and manage student performance.

Features:
Dynamic Grade Calculation: Automatically calculates total marks based on weighted scores from multiple assessments (e.g., midterm, end-term, quizzes).
Customizable Grading System: Supports scaling of grades based on predefined criteria, ensuring flexibility and adaptability to diverse evaluation standards.
Interactive Visualizations: Provides a user-friendly interface to visualize student data, grading details, and analytics.
Sorting and Filtering: Enables sorting by roll number or grade and facilitates data exploration for better performance insights.

Prerequisites:
Python 3.8 or above
Required Python libraries:
streamlit
pandas

Output
The application will generate a table with:
Total Marks: Calculated based on given weightage.
Grades: Assigned dynamically based on thresholds.
Scaled Grades: Adjusted to ensure fair distribution.
